Partical Part:-

    Steps for using SSH protocol insted of HTTPS :-
        In a few words, I don't see any different between using SSH or HTTPS, 

    A- On local Side:
        1- 'git init' to Initialize a new repo.
        2- 'git add .' to add the my files Then I need to use a 'git commit -m "Initial commit"' command to move to the next stage,

    B- On GitHub
        1- Create a GitHub Repo
        2- From My GitHub repo page I can take the SSH url
        3- Then I need to use this command 'git remote add origin <SSH_REPOSITORY_URL>' to link my local repo to the github repo.
        4- 'git push -u origin main' to upload my nuclear bomb in GitHub. :).
